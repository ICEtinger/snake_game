# Reinforcement Learning Algorithms applied on the arcade game Snake

Run the demo in the terminal using
```python
    python3 demo.py
```

`agent_RL.py` incorporates all the Reinforcement Learning algorithms used for this project.
`agent_SE.py` is the naive search algorithm used as a reference.
`environment.py` is the snake game
`geometry.py` includes some utility functions used to implement the algorithms.
